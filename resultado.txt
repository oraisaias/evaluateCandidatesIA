Alright, I'm trying to evaluate whether this candidate is suitable for the React / Redux-Saga developer position. Let me go through each requirement step by step.

First, looking at the technical skills. The candidate has hands-on experience with Redux and Redux-Saga from their job at Aeroméxico. They've implemented middleware, reducers, and state management, which directly aligns with the first priority. They also mention working on a React project where they set up data caching systems, which is great for the frontend skills.

For React, they have a strong background since their time at Walmart Global Tech and Inmersys. They've developed waste reduction systems and implemented new dashboards using React, so that's solid for the React requirement.

Testing experience: The candidate has worked with Jest and other testing libraries like Testing Library or Cypress. While the requirement only gives it a 7/10 priority, they definitely have relevant experience here.

The backend requirement isn't as prominent in their CV since they mainly focused on frontend and React projects. However, mentioning experience with IntelliJ for Java suggests some backend exposure, which is good enough to meet this level.

Git and collaboration skills are strong throughout their resume. They've used Git branches, PRs, and have remote teams, which is crucial for a remote position in CDMX.

Personality-wise, they're self-driven and proactive, which fits the bill. The ability to work remotely and solve problems effectively is highlighted multiple times.

Considering the job's focus on Redux-Saga, their experience there is spot-on. While React is also important, since it's mentioned as a priority along with Redux, this candidate should be able to handle that.

Overall, they meet all the key technical requirements with high priorities fulfilled and have good soft skills for remote work. They might need to brush up on Java if required but don't seem completely unfamiliar.

**Veredicto:** Sí

El candidato cumple con los requisitos técnicos principales del puesto, especialmente destacando su experiencia con Redux y Redux-Saga, así como su dominio avanzado en React. Tampoco se han identificado lagunas significativas que impeding su cumplimiento en los requisitos, excepto quizás una limitación ligada al Java, que no es crítica para este role.
